		<section name="Authentication">
			<p>
				User authentication consists in two different things :
				<ol>
					<li>authenticating user requests</li>
					<li>forwarding user information to the providers</li>
				</ol>
				Authentication is managed by extensions in ESIGate 4.x. In older
				versions, authentication was handled by implementations of the
				AuthenticationHandler interface.

			</p>
			<p>
				To ease update from a previous ESIGate version or simply for inspiration, an adapter between
				AuthenticationHandler and Extension is provided :
				<a
					href="esigate-core/apidocs/org/esigate/authentication/GenericAuthenticationHandler.html">GenericAuthenticationHandler</a>

			</p>

			<p>Extensions are declared for each provider. This means that ESIGate
				can get content from applications using different authentication
				systems.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Default authentication handler">
			<p>
				The default AuthenticationHandler is
				<a
					href="esigate-core/apidocs/org/esigate/authentication/RemoteUserAuthenticationHandler.html">RemoteUserAuthenticationHandler</a>
				implementation. This implementation tries to retrieve the user by
				calling the
				method request.getRemoteUser() from the container. If
				this method
				returns a user name, the name is forwarded to the
				provider in the
				"X_REMOTE_USER" HTTP header.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="CAS authentication">
			<p>
				There is also an AuthenticationHandler for CAS Single Sign On. See
				<a href="esigate-cas/index.html">CAS</a>
				for more information.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Custom authentication">
			<p>
				Any other authentication method can be implementing by writing a
				class that implements Extension or extends
				GenericAuthenticationHandler.

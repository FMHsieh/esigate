			<p>
				This toolkit was developped to help developpers to integrate
				existing web applications and make them visible to the users as
				a
				single website.
	</p>
			<p>
				This way of agregating contents extracted from other web sites
				is
				usually called
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>
				.

		</section>
		<section name="Taglib">
			<p>
				The Website Assembling Toolkit offers a taglib that can be used in
				any JSP-based java web application.
	</p>
			<p>
				Basically, the taglib looks like Tiles
				tag library except that it enables you to include contents and use
				templates coming from
				other applications that may have been written
				using any technology en deployed on other
				servers.
	</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Reverse proxy">
			<p>
				The Website Assembling Toolkit can also be used as a reverse proxy.
				Proxied pages are parsed in order
				to process inclusion instructions
				that the applications insert.
	</p>
			<p>
				It is similar to an ESI processor that would process ESI tags inside
				the pages. Future plans include ESI
				tags support but for now we use proprietary tags.
	</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Other uses">
			<p>
				Any functionality used by the taglib or the reverse proxy can be
				used through a simple API.
	</p>

		<section name="How does it work?">
			<img src="overview.jpg" />
			<p>
				HTML pages are fetched from the provider server using regular HTTP
				requests.
				Pages are then parsed to find specific delimiters used to
				define the blocks.
				The blocks are then agregated and sent to the
				browser as a single
				HTML page.

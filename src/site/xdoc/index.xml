		<section name="Reverse proxy and ESI processor">
			<p>
				The Website Assembling Toolkit can be used as a reverse proxy.
				Proxied pages can parsed in order
				to process inclusion instructions
				that the applications insert.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two different syntax are supported:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a custom syntax using HTML comments</li>
				<li>ESI syntax (partial support)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Both syntax enable to retrieve blocks of contents but custom syntax is
				much more powerfull as you can retrieve pages and use them as a template
				retrieve blocks from xpath expressions and apply xslt transformations.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Taglib">
			<p>
				The Website Assembling Toolkit offers a taglib that can be used in
				any JSP-based java web application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, the taglib looks like Tiles
				tag library except that it enables you to include contents and use
				templates coming from
				other applications that may have been written
				using any technology and deployed on other
				servers.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Other uses">
			<p>
				Any functionality used by the taglib or the reverse proxy can be
				used through a simple API.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="How it works">
			<img src="overview.jpg" />
			<p>
				HTML pages are fetched from the provider server using regular HTTP
				requests.
				Pages are then parsed to find specific delimiters used to
				define the blocks.
				The blocks are then aggregated and sent to the
				browser as a single
				HTML page.
			</p>

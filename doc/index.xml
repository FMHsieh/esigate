	<h1>What can i do with it?</h1>
	<p>
		This toolkit was developped to help developpers to integrate
		existing web applications and make them visible to the users as
		a single website.
	</p>
	<p>
		This way of agregating contents extracted from other web sites
		is usually called
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>.
	</p>
	<h1>Taglib</h1>
	<p>
		The Website Assembling Toolkit offers a taglib that can be used in any JSP-based java web application.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically, the taglib looks like Tiles 
		tag library except that it enables you to include contents and use templates coming from
		other applications that may have been written using any technology en deployed on other
		servers.
	</p>
	<h1>Reverse proxy</h1>
	<p>
		The Website Assembling Toolkit can also be used as a reverse proxy. Proxied pages are parsed in order
		to process inclusion instructions that the applications insert.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is similar to an ESI processor that would process ESI tags inside the pages. Future plans include ESI 
		tags support but for now we use proprietary tags.
	</p>
	<h1>Other uses</h1>
	<p>
		Any functionality used by the taglib or the reverse proxy can be used through a simple API.
	</p>
	<h1>How does it work?</h1>
	<img src="overview.jpg" />
	<p>
		HTML pages are fetched from the provider server using regular HTTP requests.
		Pages are then parsed to find specific delimiters used to define the blocks.
		The blocks are then agregated and sent to the browser as a single
		HTML page.

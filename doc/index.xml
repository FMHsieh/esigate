	<p>
		This toolkit was developped to help developpers to integrate
		existing web applications and make them visible to the users as
		a single website.
	</p>
	<p>
		This way of agregating contents extracted from other web sites
		is usually called
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically, working with the Website Assembling Toolkit looks like working with Tiles 
		tag library except that it enables you to include contents and use templates coming from
		other applications that may have been written using any technology en deployed on other
		servers.

		HTML pages are fetched from the provider server using regular HTTP requests.
		Pages are then parsed to find specific delimiters used to define the blocks.
		The blocks are then agregated and sent to the browser as a single
		HTML page.

	<h1>Features</h1>
	<h2>Blocks and templates</h2>
	<p>
		Any web application can be used as a provider. The master application will be 
		able to use blocks and templates delimited with special HTML comments.
	</p>
	<h2>Cross technologies</h2>
	<p>
		As we only use HTML comments inside provider applications, a provider application
		may have been developed with any technology, including Java, PHP on .NET.
	</p>
	<h2>Reverse proxy</h2>
	<p>
		The kit contains a reverse-proxy servlet that can be used to retrieve static contents
		from the provider applications (images, css, js...). For better performance, you may
		prefer to use Apache mod_proxy powerfull module but the reverse-proxy servlet may as
		well be used in a production environment with good performance.
	</p>
	<h2>Cache</h2>
	<p>
		In order to improve performance, the tool can be configured to use a cache (the underlying cache 
		implementation is the open source library OsCache). Cached entries may be long-lived or short-lived
		depending on your needs and depending on the provider application.
	</p>
	<h2>User context</h2>
	<p>
		While calling the provider application, you may want to send informations about
		the currently connected user for personalization. The tool lets you transfer the
		user id, user locale and any key/value list. These informations will be automatically
		appended as request parameters to the http request.

	Imagine you have to write a java application (master) that must include a block coming from
	an existing application (povider).
	<h1>Download the Website Assembling Toolkit</h1>
	<p>
		Download the last version from SourceForge site. Any library needed in included inside
		the distribution.
		Copy webassembletool.jar and the other libraries inside the WEB-INF/lib folder of 
		your web application.
	</p>
	<h1>Configure it</h1>
	<p>
		The tool try to load its configuration file from the classpath. Copy the exemple file from
		folder test/master/WEB-INF/classes/net/webassembletool/driver.properties into your source folder
		in net/webassembletool/driver.properties.
		Change the "remoteUrlBase" parameter to the base address of your provider application.
	</p>
	<img src="driverproperties.jpg" />
	<h1>Tag the block on the provider application</h1>
	<p>
		The block has to be tagged using special HTML comments.
	</p>
	<img src="block.jpg" />
	<h1>Retrieve the block inside a page of the master application</h1>
	<p>
		If using JSP, you can use the tag library. If not, the tool can be used as well directly using java code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose the block you want to include is inside a page http://localhost:8080/provider/mypage.php
	</p>
	<img src="includeblock.jpg" />
	<p>
		NOTE: do not forget to add the taglib declaration at the beging of the page.
	</p>
	<h1>Handling resources</h1>
	<p>
		The HTML code included may contain links to resources (images, css, scripts, links). In order to have this links
		work, there are two possibilities :
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>addind a HTML &lt;base&gt; tag in the page : you can use the tage&lt;assemble:includeBase&gt;</li>
		<li>have the resources proxied by the reverse proxy servlet</li>
	</ul>
